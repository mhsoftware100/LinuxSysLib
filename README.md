# LinuxSysLib
LinuxSysLib is a lightweight library for Linux system programming in C. It provides a collection of utility functions and wrappers for common system calls and libraries, making it easier to develop low-level software components and interact with the Linux operating system.

# Features:
  * System Calls: Simplifies the usage of system calls by providing convenient wrappers and error handling mechanisms.
  * Interprocess Communication (IPC): Includes abstractions for POSIX message queues, shared memory, and semaphores, enabling efficient communication between processes.
  * File Operations: Provides utility functions for file handling, such as reading, writing, and manipulating file attributes.
  * Networking: Offers a set of functions for network programming, including socket creation, sending and receiving data, and network configuration.
  * Process Management: Facilitates process creation, termination, and signal handling operations.
  * Logging and Debugging: Includes logging utilities for printing diagnostic messages and debugging information during runtime.
  * Memory Management: Offers memory allocation and deallocation functions, as well as memory mapping and shared memory management.
